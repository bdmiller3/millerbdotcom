My personal website. It's just stock HTML and CSS built on Sinatra deployed on Heroku.

# Exciting?!
Probably not. But the point here is that I have never had a personal
website and built this one from the ground up. I consider it a huge
pride point that I hand-coded every line of HTML and CSS, and have
endeavored to understand it (without any formal frontend learning).
Hopefully it grows :)

Lots.
